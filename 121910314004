# This program reads two numbers and prints their sum:
a = input('enter first number:')
b = input('enter second number:')

sum = float(a) + float(b)

print('the sum of {} and {} is {}'.format(a,b,sum))
# Can you change it so it can read and sum three numbers?

Output:
enter first number:4
enter second number:6
the sum of 4 and 6 is 10

import math

width = float(input('Please Enter the Width of a Right Angled Triangle: '))
height = float(input('Please Enter the Height of a Right Angled Triangle: '))

# calculate the area
Area = 0.5 * width * height

print("\n Area of a right angled triangle is: %.2f" %Area)

output:
Please Enter the Width of a Right Angled Triangle:  3
Please Enter the Height of a Right Angled Triangle:  5

 Area of a right angled triangle is: 7.50
 
 # Read a string:

print('the next number for the '+str(a)+' is '+str(a+1))
print('the previous number for the number '+str(a)+' is '+str(a-1))

output:
enter tne number:0
